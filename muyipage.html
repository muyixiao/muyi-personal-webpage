  <h1>MUYI XIAO</h1>
  <h2>New Media Narratives Program 2015-2016</h2>

  <p>
    From missing flight MH370 to a cult religion called “Mighty God”, Muyi Xiao has covered a wide range of stories throughout China during her time as a photojournalist for Tencent, China’s largest online media outlet. These dispatch assignments exposed Muyi to a broad range of issues in her home country, inspiring her to pursue long-term stories as a freelance photographer. In 2015 summer, she quit her job upon receiving one of the seven Magnum Foundation Photography and Human Rights fellowships. During her time in New York, Muyi discovered a passion for multimedia storytelling. She continue her photographic education this fall at the International Center of Photography’s New Media Narratives program.
